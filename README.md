# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis 🚲  
**Google Data Analytics Capstone Project**  
**Author:** Narender Singh Yadav

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project investigates how casual riders and annual members of Cyclistic—a fictional bike-share company in Chicago—use bikes differently. The goal is to derive actionable insights that inform a marketing strategy aimed at converting casual users into loyal annual members, ultimately driving long-term profitability.

## 🧩 Business Task  
Cyclistic wants to increase its number of annual members. To support this goal, the marketing analytics team must answer:
> **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**

Based on the insights, a data-driven strategy will be proposed to convert more casual riders into members.

## 📊 Data Source  
- **Time Frame:** 12 months (2019–2020)  
- **Data:** Over 5 million individual trip records  
- **Source:** [Divvy Bike-Share Public Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Presentation:** PowerPoint

## 🧼 Data Cleaning  
- Combined quarterly datasets  
- Standardized column names  
- Removed nulls and filtered age (18–60)  
- Calculated derived columns: ride length, day of week, start hour  
- Outliers removed using IQR method

## 📈 Key Insights  
- **Ride Duration:** Casual riders take 54.39% longer rides than members (17.97 min vs. 11.53 min)  
- **Time of Use:** Casual riders prefer weekends; members use bikes during weekday commutes  
- **Seasonality:** Casual usage spikes in summer; member usage is more stable  
- **Demographics:** Most riders are aged 25–34, a prime target for conversion

## 📌 Recommendations  
1. **Weekday Incentives:** Encourage commuting among casual riders  
2. **Summer Promotions:** Boost memberships during seasonal peaks  
3. **Targeted Marketing:** Focus on riders aged 25–34
